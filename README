wwwsh - a remote shell over http

This is a proof of concept for a remote shell that works although the target PC
has a installed and active personal firewall.

It was tested with the newest versions of all existing personal firewalls and
none could block this attack.

This software is shared under the terms of the GPL. It is meant as a proof of
concept to show the weakness of personal firewalls. Don't use it to do any
harm.

The shell consists of two parts: the server part running remotely on a computer
under your control and the client part which is dropped as a trojan horse on
the target PC.

Before the client part is started the server has to be up.

The server is a slimed webserver and has nothing special. Actually it formerly 
was an apache webserver using some cgi scripts.

The client uses Windows' message system to start a browser and command it. By
surfing webpages of the server's domain information is transported out of the
target PC. To get information back into the target system the server always
replies with a page having a meta refresh tag set so that the browser surfes to
a new location. This location is shown on the browser's window from where the
client can read it. For both inbound and outbound communication information is
base64 encoded and part of the used urls.

The browser window is visible. This is no bug but wanted for demonstartion
purposes. But it is no problem to make the window either not visible for the
user or even completely invisible.
